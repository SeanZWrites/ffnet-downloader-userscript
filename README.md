# FFNet Downloader Userscript

A simple, small Greasemonkey script that adds a Download button to 
stories on fanfiction.net. 

## Installation

This is a user script (also called a Greasemonkey script). It requires a
user-script browser extension, such as ViolentMonkey, TamperMonkey, or
Greasemonkey. Once you have that, you can proceed.

Each user script extension has a slightly different way of installing scripts,
but the general operation is:
  1. Click on the User Script Manager icon, and then click 'Add Script'
  2. Copy the contents of the `FFnetDownloader.js` from this repo, and paste it
     into your newly created script.
  3. Save the script. 

You're now ready to use this tool.

## Usage

Once the script is installed and enabled, if you navigate in your browser to any
story on fanfiction.net, you'll see a 'Download' button in the upper-right
corner of the screen.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issues installing the script, I wrote a [tutorial on writing
your own user scripts on my
blog](https://seanzwrites.com/posts/creating-custom-filters-on-ao3/). That goes
into much more detail on how user scripts work, how to install them, and how to
debug any issues that might arise.
